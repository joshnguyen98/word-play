# Word play

## Motivation

The objective of this small collection of tasks is to get you familiarised with some of the very powerful command line utilities available to you. This site is a [good source of documentation.](http://oliverelliott.org/article/computing/ref_unix/). Remember to look carefully throughout the first 20 commands to see if any of them will be useful. You should be able to complete all of these tasks with pure command line magic. 

For each of the tasks below you can use the redirect operator `>` in order to generate a `.txt` file after running a command.

Good luck ðŸ˜„


## Tasks

1. Create a file called `first_10_words.txt` with the first 10 words from the word_list. Research the `head` command for this one.

2. Create a file called `last_10_words.txt` with the last 10 words from `word_list`.

3. Create a file called `word_count.txt` containing a count of all the words in the `word_list`.

4. Create a file called the `reversed_words.txt` with all the of the words from `word_list` but in reverse order. 

5. Create a file called `3_or_more_vowels.txt` featuring all the words in the list that contain 3 or more vowels.
Research `grep` or `egrep` for this problem.

6. Create a file called `b--.txt` with all the words starting with the letter b and ending in exactly 2 vowels.

7. Create a file consisting of all the 2 letters words. Store them in a file called `2_letters_only.txt`

8. Create a file containing a count of all the words starting with p to all the words starting with r - store the count in a file called `p_to_r.txt`. **Add** a word count to the end of the `p_to_r.txt` with a word count for the file.
